        <h2>Description</h2>
        We won't get into the fiery debate between charcoal versus gas grills here â€” we've covered that in depth. But for certain, great grilling can be had with either charcoal or gas.
        <br><br>
        We've also covered how to pick the best steak for grilling. The good news is, the perfect steak doesn't need to be the most expensive. If breaking the bank isn't part of your barbeque plan, consider less spendy sirloin, hanger, flank steak, and skirt steaks.
